# Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write components by enabling state and other React features in functional components. In this guide, we'll explore the most commonly used hooks and their practical applications.

## Understanding useState

The `useState` hook is your gateway to managing state in functional components. Let's look at a simple example:

```javascript
function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  return (
    <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
      Count: {count}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Working with useEffect

`useEffect` lets you perform side effects in your components. Here are some common use cases:

### Data Fetching
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  async function fetchData() {
    const response = await api.getData();
    setData(response);
  }
  fetchData();
}, []);
```

### Event Listeners
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

## Custom Hooks

Creating custom hooks allows you to extract component logic into reusable functions:

```javascript
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => {
      setSize({
        width: window.innerWidth,
        height: window.innerHeight
      });
    };

    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  }, []);

  return size;
}
```

## Best Practices

When working with hooks, keep these guidelines in mind:

1. Always call hooks at the top level
2. Only call hooks from React function components
3. Use the ESLint plugin for hooks
4. Keep your dependencies array accurate

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more elegant way to reuse stateful logic and manage side effects in your components. By understanding these core concepts, you'll be better equipped to build maintainable React applications.
